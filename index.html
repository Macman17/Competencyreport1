                <p class="south roof">My name is Naqui Darby. I was born in Newark, NJ, where I stayed until the age of 6. My mother decided to relocate me and my six siblings to <Sup>1</Sup>Columbia, SC in order to be closer to my grandparents.This is where I would spend the rest of my childhood before joining the military. I had no idea what to expect when I joined the military, but living with my mother prepared me for the stressors of the military. My first job in the military was a supply warehouse specialist. When I reenlisted I decided to change jobs in order to gain more skills so I decided to become a career retention specialist. This allowed me face some of my fears and took me out of my confort zone, which I loved. I got out of the military in 2017 in hopes of starting my own business and finishing school. </p>
                <!--The degree I received was in business management-->
